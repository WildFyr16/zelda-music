# About
I created this pack for all the Zelda lovers out there who find themselve turning the base Minecraft music down everytime they start a world.
The music of Minecrat is nice to listen to, but it can get repetitive and donâ€™t even get me started on the cave sounds. Now, that has all been replaced. With the wonderful work of Koji Kondo and music from the whole Zelda francise.

This pack changes sound effects, game music, and the music discs all for your listening pleasure. On top of this I am always adding and updating fresh sounds and songs, feel free to [suggest your additions too](https://github.com/WildFyr16/zelda-music/issues/new?assignees=WildFyr16&labels=suggestion&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
